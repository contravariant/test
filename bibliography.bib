	Note = {The strategic perspectives and terminology of the fundamental law is a common frame- work in the practice of active portfolio management. For tractability, fundamental law theory depends on the simplifying assumption of a diagonal covariance matrix of security returns, though the matrices supplied to numerical optimizers are fully populated. We extend the fundamental law of active management to allow for a full covariance matrix and show that the resulting ex-ante (expected) and ex-post (realized) return equations are exact in contrast to the approximate equality of previous derivations. The exactness of ex-post equations allows for performance attribution of realized returns that completely decomposes the return. Because the various fundamental law parameters we define incor- porate all the information in the covariance matrix, they should also provide better ex-ante insights as to the sources and limitations of risk-adjusted active return. In addition to the generalization of the fundamental law, we describe a full covariance matrix alpha gener- ation process and add some comments to the concept of implied breadth. The mathematics and practical application of the full covariance matrix fundamental law parameters are illustrated using an EAFE benchmarked portfolio with the 21 countries as individual securities.},

In this study we turn attention to the influence of these factors on the equity returns in emerging markets economies. This is timely because of the resurgent interest in emerging markets equities and because these equities offer a more acute perspective on the countries-versus-sectors debate. The findings of this study shed light on whether the globalization of capital markets extends to emerging economies. Our results show that in respect to emerging markets equities, the country factor strongly dominates sector and industry. The evidence suggests that diversification across emerging countries has provided greater risk reduction for emerging markets equity portfolios than diversification by industries during the past decade. It also suggests that country allocation will likely remain an important consideration for active managers of emerging markets equity portfolios.},

First, we explain why discarding small firms may overstate the relative importance of sector effects in international stock returns: small caps turn out to have an above average variability (after controlling for sector and country effects) and to be less exposed to their global sector index than large caps. Secondly, we show that the unit exposure assumption in Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994) is empirically not valid, and we accordingly generalize the HR-methodology by taking into account the unequal distribution of exposures along countries and sectors. Thirdly, we decompose the stacked variance of exposures and factors into his moments and correct it for estimation error in the exposures. We show that ignoring exposures and estimation error in the exposures may also overstate the impact of sector effects on international stock returns. Lastly, we show that there is no necessary link between the outcome of the HR-methodology and benefits of international risk diversification.},

We transform indirect cash flow method statements into disaggregated and more direct estimates of cash flows from operations and other sources. We form portfolios based on these ``direct method'' cash flow measures. Stocks in the highest cash flow decile outperform those in the lowest decile by over 10\% annually, risk-adjusted. Our results are robust to investment horizons, and across risk factors, including controlling for sector differences. We also show that, in addition to operating cash flow information, cash taxes and capital expenditures provide incremental predictive power.},

During the 1964--2002 sample period, net operating assets scaled by total assets is a strong negative predictor of long-run stock returns.

Prior research finds that expected returns increase in firm profitability. However, firms with high accruals generate lower returns than firms with low accruals, and this ``accrual anomaly'' strengthens when evaluated using asset pricing models that include a profitability factor. We show that a cash-based operating profitability measure (that excludes accruals) outperforms other measures of profitability (that include accruals) and subsumes accruals in predicting the cross section of average returns. Surprisingly, an investor can increase a strategy's Sharpe ratio more by adding just a cash-based operating profitability factor to his investment opportunity set than by adding both an accruals factor and a profitability factor that includes accruals.},
